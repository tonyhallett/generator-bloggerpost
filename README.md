# About

This is a yeoman generator for the npm package [blogger-post](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blogger-post).  It prompts for the required information and adds it to package.json so that the blogger-post commands work as expected.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-bloggerpost using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-post
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo bloggerpost
```
